        <p class="fs-5">An authentication project is a critical component of any secure digital system, designed to verify
            user identities and
            protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. This project typically involves implementing secure login
            mechanisms
            using technologies like JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth2, or multi-factor authentication (MFA). It may include user
            registration, password hashing with bcrypt or Argon2, session management, and role-based access control to
            ensure that
            users only access resources appropriate to their permissions. A well-structured authentication system not only
            enhances
            security but also improves user experience by streamlining access across platforms. Whether integrated into a
            Laravel
            backend or a React frontend, the project demands careful attention to encryption, token expiration, and error
            handling
            to maintain both usability and resilience against threats like brute-force attacks or token hijacking.</p>
